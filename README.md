# Energy-Star-Score-Prediction
Our goal is to use the available data to build a model that predicts the amount of Energy Star Score for a particular building, and interpret the results to find the factors that affect the final score.
The data already includes Energy Star Score scores, so our task is machine learning with controlled methodology of regressors.
The objective is to use the energy data to build a model that can predict the Energy Star Score of a building and interpret the results to find the factors which influence the score.The data includes the Energy Star Score, which makes this a supervised regression machine learning task:

Supervised: we have access to both the features and the target and our goal is to train a model that can learn a mapping between the two
Regression: The Energy Star score is a continuous variable
We want to develop a model that is both accurate *— it can predict the Energy Star Score close to the true value — and *interpretable — we can understand the model predictions. Once we know the goal, we can use it to guide our decisions as we dig into the data and build models.
