# Energy-Star-Score-Prediction
Our goal is to use the available data to build a model that predicts the amount of Energy Star Score for a particular building, and interpret the results to find the factors that affect the final score.
The data already includes Energy Star Score scores, so our task is machine learning with controlled methodology of regressors.
